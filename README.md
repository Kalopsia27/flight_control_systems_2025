## 🎯 Objectives

- Gain strong theoretical and practical understanding of flight control systems
- Develop and simulate control architectures (PID, state-space, GNC frameworks)
- Model aircraft dynamics and implement feedback loops in MATLAB and Python
- Build a portfolio of mini-projects and notes to showcase control engineering skills
- Contribute towards my long-term goal of becoming a world-class aerospace engineer
